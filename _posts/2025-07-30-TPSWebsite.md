# Introduction

For the past month, I worked on creating a new website for the Technology Policy Society at JHU to better capture the scope and impact of the organization's work.

# Development Notes

Since this is purely a frontend project, I started out with bootstrapping Create React App.
```bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

Then, I created a basic structure for my multipage website that utilizes react-router-dom. 

```bash
components/
├── Navigation.tsx
├── MainPage.tsx
├── ProjectPage.tsx
├── ResourcePage.tsx
├── TeamPage.tsx
├── TeamCards.tsx
├── Footer.tsx
└── and CSS files for all components
```
